**People Counting**

This is a Python implementation of a person counting algorithm using the YOLOv8 object detection model and a centroid tracker. The algorithm can be used to count the number of people entering and exiting a premise from a given video feed.

**Requirements**

* Python 3
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Ultralytics
* Tracker

**Installation**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Usage**

To run the people counter, simply execute the following command:

```
python3 mains.py
```

The program will read the input video file from the `input_videos` directory and write the output video file to the `output_videos` directory. The output video file will display the entry , exit counts and FPS on the video screen.
